ABookCase Orbital Reference System (KSP mod)

Simply mouse over an orbit of the current craft in map view to see time and altitude information.


Forum user @zentarul made this nice little mod at the request of Twitch streamer ABookCase.  It hasn't been updated since KSP 1.2, and I had a request to update it.  Original thread is here:https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/131706-12-abookcase-orbital-reference-system-0410/&

This is a request from ABookCase who wanted a simple mod that displays altitude of an orbit at a point by hovering the mouse over it.

Now available via CKAN

Main change is that there is now a Settings page, available in the stock settings page, and no more need for a local config file.

The mouse is not shown in the screenshots, but I'm sure you can imagine it.
